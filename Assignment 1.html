            The project i am currently working on is my final year B.Tech project titled <b><u>Artificial Feel and Control Loading System for a Flight Simulator.</u></b>
            I recently finished a research internship in an organization called <b><u>SSERD</u>(Society for Space Education, Research and Development)</b>,
            where i was a part of the lunar rover team (TEAM CHAAND). Our team worked on building a 
            <b><u>Swarm Lunar Rover System</u></b> (the communication between the rovers,
            the chasis of the mother & child rovers and the power source using wireless power transmission).
            I also had the opportunity to do an internship in <b><u>Hindustan aeronautics ltd., Banglore</u></b> in the summer of 2019, 
            where i got to learn about the helicopter <b><u>ALH DHRUV</u></b> and  the working of <b><u>Quality Engineering Department of the Helicopter Division, HAL</u></b>. 
            In addition to these I attended a <b>Girls X Tech design bootcamp</b> last month,
             where i got the opportunity to learn and create projects in Canva.
